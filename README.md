## IMPORTANT
IntelliJ sometimes creates separated modules for main and test, which leading to errors.
To solve this issue, please manually change this setting for main and test folder by right clicking main and test folder, and select "Remove Module" 

when building the client, please start the server first, and wait for it to start for 10 sec, otherwise the unit test in the client might fail.
